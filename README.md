Who Says What (WSW) is a pre-trained language model (PLM) which is designed to model who says what in multi-party conversations (MPCs) to understand equipping the discourse parsing in deep semantic structures and contextualized representations of utterances and interlocutors. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use the relative semantic distance of utterances in MPCs to design self-supervised tasks for MPC utterance structure modelling and MPC utterance semantic modelling.
